Set up your development environment: Install Node.js and create a new React project using Create React App. You'll also want to install Zustand for state management.

Build the user interface: Create a basic user interface for your app using React components. You'll need to include input fields for the image or video file, caption, and post time.

Add the ability to upload images or videos: Use the React Dropzone library to allow users to upload images or videos for their posts.

Add date and time pickers: Use a date and time picker library such as React DateTime or React DatePicker to allow users to select the date and time they want their post to go live.

Implement state management with Zustand: Use Zustand to manage the state of your app, including the user's inputs for their post and the scheduled date and time.

Integrate with the Instagram API: Use the Instagram API to authenticate the user and schedule the post. You'll need to get the user's access token and use it to make a request to the Instagram API to create a post.

Deploy the app: Deploy your app to a hosting service like Heroku or Netlify.

Keep in mind that there are many details to consider when building a web app like this, including error handling, data validation, and user experience design. You'll also want to make sure that you comply with Instagram's terms of service and API usage policies.
